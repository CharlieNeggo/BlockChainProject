# BlockChainProject

This is a side project of mine learning more about blockchains and how it works
nothing too crazy

 - Can use postman to send request for transaction, mine block, connect nodes for example
 - Not sure what else I would add onto this but gonna play around and maybe add some basic form of smart contracts to learn more about it.
 - Can use vs code/pycharm or whatever IDE you prefer to run this and debug this
